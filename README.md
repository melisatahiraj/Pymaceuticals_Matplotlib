## Requirements

#### Prepare the Data

    - The datasets are merged into a single DataFrame
    - The number of mice are shown from the merged DataFrame
    - Each duplicate mice is found based on the Mouse ID and Timepoint
    - A clean DataFrame is created with the dropped duplicate mice
    - The number of mice are shown from the clean DataFrame

#### Generate Summary Statistics

    - The mean of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby
    - The media of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby
    - The variance of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby
    - The standard deviation of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby
    - The SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen is calculated using groupby
    - A new DataFrame is created with using the summary statistics

#### Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts

    - A bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen using Pandas is generated
    - A bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen using pyplot is generated
    - A pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using Pandas is generated
    - A pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pyplot is generated

#### Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot

    - A DataFrame that has the last timepoint for each mouse ID is created using groupby
    - The index of the DataFrame is reset
    - Retrieve the maximum timepoint for each mouse
    - The four treatment groups, Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, are put in a list
    - An empty list is created to fill with tumor volume data
    - A for loop is used to display the interquartile range (IQR) and the outliers for each treatment group
    - A box plot is generated that shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group

#### Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot

    - A line plot is generated that shows the tumor volume vs. time point for one mouse treated with Capomulin
    - A scatter plot is generated that shows average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen

#### Calculate Correlation and Regression

    - The correlation coefficient and linear regression model are calculated for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen
